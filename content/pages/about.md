My name is James, and I like to understand things. Back when I taught
students, I learned the hard but universal lesson: you only understand
something when you've taught it to others. Now, when I'm learning something,
I write articles as if I was teaching it to an earlier me -- as a side
benefit, other people have found these articles helped them understand!

I write these guides for the
"[Journeyman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journeyman)" audience: people who
know how and why to use something, but want a deeper understanding about a
particular aspect. Developing a mental model of how a tool works (even
simplified!) allows one to reason through novel scenarios and find more
effective and efficient solutions. In these articles, I'll explore aspects of
some tools I use, building up these types of mental models.
