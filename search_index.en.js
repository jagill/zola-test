name is James, and I like to understand things. Back when I taught\nstudents, I learned the hard but universal lesson: you only understand\nsomething when you've taught it to others. Now, when I'm learning something,\nI write articles as if I was teaching it to an earlier me -- as a side\nbenefit, other people have found these articles helped them understand!\nI write these guides for the\n\"Journeyman\" audience: people who\nknow how and why to use something, but want a deeper understanding about a\nparticular aspect. Developing a mental model of how a tool works (even\nsimplified!) allows one to reason through novel scenarios and find more\neffective and efficient solutions. In these articles, I'll explore aspects of\nsome tools I use, building up these types of mental models.\nYou can also find me on Github ( jagill)\nand LinkedIn ( jagill)\n","id":"https://jagill.github.io/zola-test/about/","title":"Journeyman Guides: Some technical explorations"},"https://jagill.github.io/zola-test/articles/":{"body":"","id":"https://jagill.github.io/zola-test/articles/","title":"Minor writings"},"https://jagill.github.io/zola-test/computer-memory/":{"body":"While I've long known a computer runs by manipulating bits, I didn't have a\ngood mental model of where those bits are stored and how they are accessed.\nI've had to build that understanding over the years, which has helped greatly\nas I've optimized training pipelines for neural nets, or developed data\nstructures for high-performance computing. Talking to colleagues in the\nindustry, I've found many of them are also uncertain about some foundational\ndetails. This article will build a mental model of computer memory, so that\nyou can reason about the computer's memory model, and why certain things are\nfast and others slow.\n\nFirst I'll talk about chunking bits into bytes and words. Second, I'll\ntalk about registers and how all operations are ultimately done on those.\nNext I'll talk about RAM, the special registers that deal with it, and what\nallocation and deallocation mean. This will allow us to describe the\nstack, and how data is transferred to and from function calls. The\nlimitations of the stack will introduce the heap, and some more strategies\nfor allocation and deallocation. I'll briefly discuss disks and\nsecondary storage. Virtual Memory will be a powerful construct that allows\nus to blur the boundaries between disks and RAM, and it sets up the\ndifference between kernel space and user space and how kernels manage the\nmemory of multiple processes. These processes might use inter-process\ncommunication, which can be expensive. Threads are an alternative that are\ncheaper but have their own tradeoffs. Lastly, I'll talk about CPU caches,\nwhich are critical to how modern CPUs are so fast.\nThese pieces will build up the memory hierarchy, which are layers of\nprogressively larger and slower types of memory.  This hierarchy consists --\nfrom fastest to largest -- of registers, CPU caches, RAM, and disks.  Efficient\ncomputation keeps frequently and imminently needed data in the lower levels of\nthe hierarchy, using the higher levels as storage.\nReaders who know this material will find many places where I ignore lots of\ndetails, some of which may be considered important. I'll intentionally\nsimplify the mental model of memory to give people an intuition as to what's\nhappening, but this necessitates being a bit fast and loose. I encourage\ninterested readers to dig deeper into the details from other sources.  I've\nlisted some I particularly like at the end.\nBits, Bytes, and Words🔗\nBits are things that can be in two positions, which we traditionally call 0\nor 1. In modern computers, they may be tiny capacitors, tiny magnetic\nregions, or more. The details of a bit won't concern us, but you should know\nthat there are trade-offs involved in the choice of bit-material: speed,\ncost, volatility, and more. If you wonder why we don't just build all of our\nmemory with the super-fast stuff, know that there is a reason (and it's not\njust cost!).\nThe smallest number of bits that modern computers can reasonably access is 8,\ncalled a byte. To check an individual bit, the computer would need to load a\nbyte then check the bit (by something like an AND operation).\nComputers based on single bytes fell out of favor some time ago. The\narchitecture started assuming multi-byte chunks as a primitive memory size:\nfirst 2 bytes, then 4 bytes, then 8 bytes on most modern architectures. This\nnatural chunk size is called a word. Let's simplify our discussion (at a\nsmall cost in accuracy) by assuming that all memory movements, computations,\netc are done in units of a word.1\n1\nActually, movement between RAM and the CPU is done in units\nof cache-lines, and from disk to RAM in units of pages.  We'll discuss these,\nbut it won't affect our mental model.\n\nALUs, Registers, and CPUs🔗\nThe fundamental computation unit of a computer is called the Arithmetic\nLogical Unit, or ALU. Its job is to combine either one or two input words\nto produce an output word. For example, it might negate an integer, add two\nintegers to produce their sum, or XOR two words.2. These words\nare stored in registers, which are very fast word-sized pieces of memory\nthat are very close to the ALU. Often, the ALU will combine two registers and\nstore the output in one of those two registers, although this is not always\nthe case.\nWhich two registers are used, and what should be done with them, is\ncontrolled by the Central Processing Unit, or CPU. While most registers\nare general purpose (with descriptive names like A, B, C, D...), some have\nspecial purposes. One of those is the Instruction Register (IR) which\nholds a value which tells the CPU which operation it should perform and on\nwhich registers. Another is the Program Counter (PC), which holds a word\nthat is the memory address in RAM (see below) of the next instruction. Very\nroughly, the CPU will load the word at the address of the Program Counter\ninto the Instruction Register, increment the Program Counter, then perform\nthat operation in the Instruction Register on the specified registers. This\nsequence is called a cycle, and it's the fundamental unit of time for a\ncomputer.\nTo keep things interesting, some the operations can change the value of the\nProgram Counter to jump around the program. This enables loops, if-then-else,\nand other control flow statements.\n2\nThere are other bits that are inputs and outputs to the\nALU, like carry bits for addition, or various outcomes when you compare two\nwords. They aren't critical to understanding the memory model.\n\nRAM and the memory registers🔗\nThe amount of memory that can be held in the registers is too small to\ncontain the necessary information for any non-trivial program. For that, we\nneed Random Access Memory, which is a large pool of memory that is\nrelatively slow (compared to registers) and far from the CPU. The program (a\nsequence of instructions) is stored in RAM. I mentioned above how the Program\nCounter and Instruction Register are used to read and execute instructions\nfrom RAM, and something similar is done for data.\nTo get values to and from RAM, we use two special registers call the Memory\nAddress Register (MAR) and the Memory Data Register (MDR). The Memory\nAddress Register contains the address in RAM that we'll be reading or\nwriting, and the Memory Data Register will contain the value that we'll\nwrite, or it will be the destination of the value that we'll read. Then the\nCPU can move the values to/from the Memory Data Register from/to the general\npurpose registers, allowing the ALU to effectively operate on data in RAM.\nIn addition to the special part of RAM that contains the program\ninstructions, the constant values of the program are stored in a special\nstatic block of memory that exists for the length of the process. When you\nwrite the expression global int x = 5; the value 5 is stored in the\nstatic block, and accessed by its memory location.\nWhile a process could use RAM as an unstructured space of memory, it would\nneed to keep track of which locations are in use and which could be used for\nnew storage. This problem is called allocation, and it is hard. It would\nalso need to keep track of when and where it can free memory that it was\nusing, but no longer needs. This is called deallocation, and it is also\nhard. It gets much harder when you have multiple processes running\nsimultaneously, which modern computers generally do!\nTo reduce this problem to a manageable complexity, first we'll discuss how a\nsingle process structures its memory, then how an operating system keeps\nprocesses from stepping on each other's data.\nThe Stack🔗\nA way of managing allocations and deallocations is a call stack (or just\nstack). This is a more structured method for memory management that is the\nbasis of all modern computing. As its name implies, the stack is a region of\nmemory that grows by pushing values on to the end, and popping values off of\nthat same end. In most computer architectures, the stack starts at an address\nand grows down, to lower memory addresses3.\nA subroutine is a block of instructions (like a function) that is separated\nfrom the main routine, in execution and in data. The main routine can call\nsubroutines, but subroutines can also call subroutines. At any given point,\nthe process is in a subroutine at some level of nesting, with the subroutine\nthat called it above it, and so on until the main routine.\nSubroutines allow us to organize the stack into blocks called stack frames.\nWhen a subroutine starts, it adds the memory location of the calling\ninstruction to the stack, and any arguments to the function\ncall4. This is considered the start of the stack frame, and a\nspecial register called the frame pointer will store the memory address of\nthe start of the frame. Another special register called the stack pointer\nwill also start with the address just after the frame pointer, which points\nto the first free memory of the stack frame. As a variable local to the\nfunction is allocated, the stack pointer is decremented by the size of the\nvariable, and the value of the variable is written at the position of the\nstack pointer.\nWhen this variable needs to be referenced, it can be referenced by the stack\npointer minus some offset. When the function returns, the stack pointer can be\nreset to the frame pointer, deallocating the entire frame in a single\noperation. The calling instruction can be easily read, and control returned\nto it. The return value, if any, of the subroutine can be stored in a\nregister to be used by the calling process.\nNote that the stack generally has a maximum size. If a process tries to\nallocate too much memory on the stack (perhaps due to runaway recursion), this\nlimit might be exceeded, and the process will halt with a stack overflow\nerror.\n3\nIn some microcontrollers (like the 8051), the stack grows\nup.\n\n4\nOther things can go in the stack frame. For example, Java puts\nstack trace information, so that as an exception bubbles up, it can contain\nuseful information for debugging. This comes at a cost in the memory size of\na stack frame.  Also, the compiler generally pre-allocates space for local \nvariables when it creates the stack frame.\n\nThe Heap🔗\nCertain structures are not well suited for the stack. Consider an array that\ncan grow, for example as a base of a Vector or List. When it is created, a\nfixed chunk of memory is reserved for it (to hold, say, 512 elements). If it\nneeds to grow to more than its initial capacity will allow, it will need more\nmemory. On the stack, it's quite possible that something else will have been\nallocated right after it, which means it cannot grow without displacing\nsomething. Structures that have unknown or changing size requirements\nnecessitate another form of memory management.\nEnter the heap. This is a large region of memory (generally the vast\nmajority of the memory available to the process) which can be reserved\npiecemeal anywhere that it is not in use. Access to the heap is controlled by\nthe allocator: the process requests a chunk of memory of a given size, the\nallocator is responsible for returning an address of memory that is the start\nof a chunk of the requested size that is not in use. This means the allocator\nhas to know which regions of the heap are in use, and quickly find a region not\nin use of the requested size. This is much slower and less efficient than\nstack allocation, which just requires incrementing the stack pointer!\nIn order for a process to not run out of heap memory, it will need to free the\nheap memory it is no longer using: this is called deallocation. Knowing what\nvariables are no longer in use is hard! So is freeing them efficiently, and in\na way that doesn't leave the heap too fragmented to allocate the memory for any\nlarge variables.\nTo allocate and deallocate efficiently, the implementations of each are very\nintertwined. One of the most foundational and impactful choices when creating\na programming language is the choice of heap memory management. Some, like C\nand older editions of C++, require the programmer to manually mark a variable\nas no longer in use. Bugs can cause cryptic crashes, memory corruption, and\nsecurity vulnerabilities. Some, like Java or Python, use a garbage collector,\nfreeing the programmer from that responsibility, but use up system resource\nand cause occasional garbage-collection hangs. Other languages rely heavily\non the compiler: Objective-C, Swift, and modern C++ insert reference counts,\nso that the compiler knows when a variable is no longer being used, and can\ninsert a deallocation call. Rust variables have an enforced concept of\nownership, and when a variable has no active owner, the compiler can add a\ndeallocation call here as well.\nROM🔗\nTo start up a computer, a bootstrap program needs to run. After some initial\nactions, this bootstrap program loads the main program (generally the\noperating system) into RAM. Since RAM is reset when the computer is turned\noff, where does this bootstrap program live? There is a special kind of\nnon-volatile memory called Read Only Memory (ROM) which persists its data\neven without power.\nDisks and Virtual Memory🔗\nUsing RAM to contain the program and the data has a couple limitations:\n\nWhen a computer is off, its RAM loses all its data,\nThe program must be small enough to fit into RAM, and\nThe data must be small enough to fit into the rest of the RAM.\n\nMost of the time programs and persistent data live on disks, which we call\nsecondary storage (RAM is also called primary storage). Much as RAM is\nmuch slower but much larger than the registers, disk drives are typically\nmuch slower but much larger than RAM. The kernel (see below) and drivers\nabstract the details of how the data is stored and accessed from the process.\nFor our purposes, we can view secondary storage as an effectively infinite,\nyet quite slow, form of memory.\nTo allow the process to access secondary storage, the kernel provides an\nabstraction called virtual memory. Virtual memory is a level of indirection\nbetween the memory the process sees, and the physical RAM and secondary\nstorage. We'll call RAM physical memory, and divide it up into chunks of\nsize 4 kB called frames. Each process will be allocated a logical memory\nspace, which is divided into pages (the same size as frames). The process\nrefers to memory using a logical address (a page number and an offset within\nthe page), and the Memory Management Unit (MMU) of the CPU translates\nthis into a physical address, and the process transparently accesses the\nphysical memory. The MMU does this by maintaining a page table, which\nrecords if a page has a frame allocated, and if so, which one. This has two\nmajor benefits.\nThe first benefit is that the logical memory space can be larger than\navailable (or allotted) physical memory, by using secondary storage. A\nportion of the secondary storage is allocated for virtual memory, large\nenough to hold the memory allocated. When a page is requested and it maps to\na frame, the frame is accessed as normal. If it doesn't map to a frame, but\nthere is an unassigned frame, then the unassigned frame is assigned to the\npage, and again the process uses the memory as normal. But if there is no\nframe available, the kernel (see below) choose a frame that's \"quiet\" and\nswaps it out by saving it to disk, reassigning the frame from its original\npage to the new page. When this happens, it's called a page fault, and it's\nmuch more expensive than accessing memory normally. If only a small number of\npages are accessed at a given time, there will be few page faults and\nexecution will be almost as fast as if everything was in RAM. If operating\nsystems can predict which pages will be used, they can pre-fetch them, so\nthat the process doesn't notice. However, if pages must be swapped\nfrequently, then the CPU will be idle a significant amount of time, waiting\nfor disk reads/writes. This is called thrashing, and leads to very poor\nperformance.\nThe second benefit is that each running process can have its own logical\nmemory space, and the MMU will ensure that each process can only access the\nallowed part of the physical memory. When one process is less active, it can\nbe partially or entirely swapped out, freeing more memory for processes that\nare running hotter. This way, each process just sees a contiguous dedicated\nblock of memory, and can allocate and deallocate as if it were the only\nprocess running.\nAn optimization is possible for processes that share the same program: each\nprocess's pages that map to the program's instructions can point to the same\nframes in RAM, so multiple copies of the same program don't need to be\nloaded. Similarly, if multiple processes depend on the same library, that\nlibrary can be loaded just once in memory.\nKernel Space and User Space🔗\nA modern computer tends to run hundreds of processes at a given time. The\nkernel controls these processes: starting, stopping, giving access to CPUs\nand RAM. The kernel reserves a big portion of RAM for itself, called kernel\nspace. No other process can touch this RAM. When a process is started, it is\nallocated a virtual memory space. This virtual memory is all the process is\nallowed to access, and no other process (except the kernel) is allowed to\naccess it. The kernel is responsible for mapping the virtual memory to RAM,\nand swapping pages to disk (discussed last section). This means that\nprocesses can access their memory as if it was a contiguous block dedicated\nto them, and the kernel will prevent other processes from writing to and\nreading from it.\nKernels ultimately control access to resources. They allocate a certain\namount of RAM to the process, schedule execution on the CPU, and control\naccess to any IO, like a disk or the network. A process can request access to\nthis via a system call; process execution stops as the kernel performs the\nrequested action, then returns control to the process with the desired\nresult. This blocking makes a system call expensive.\nKernels can go even further by stopping processes and restarting them. When\nit stops a process it can swap out the entirety of a stopped process's\nmemory, freeing that RAM for other processes. If it does this, it must also\nsave the contents of the registers to be restored.\nInter-process communication🔗\nSince in general processes don't share memory, inter-process communication\ninvolves the sending process to serialize objects, and write then to a pipe\nor other communication channel. The receiver reads from this channel, and\nwrites a copy of the data to its own memory. This is expensive for large\namounts of data. Since the data is copied, one process will not change data\nunderneath another process, and the copies may diverge as the two processes\nmanipulate them.\nShared memory can be used instead of copying the data. Shared memory is a\nregion of physical memory that multiple processes can access: pages of their\nlogical memory map to it. This allows very quick inter-process communication,\nsince only the pointer needs to be transferred. However, shared memory\nsuffers from the same issues as any other concurrent data access: multiple\nprocesses can simultaneously attempt to access the data. In the best case,\nthis leads to slowness over lock contention, but it can also lead to data\ncorruption and undefined behavior.\nThreads🔗\nThreads are often described as \"lightweight processes\". The kernel\nallocates resources to the process, but will schedule execution to the\nthread. A process's main execution is the main thread; a basic process has\nonly this one thread. However, a process can request additional kernel\nthreads from the kernel. Each thread will have shared access to the program\ndata, the heap, and any file/etc resources, but will have its own stack. This\nmakes starting a new thread cheaper than a new process, because no additional\nresources (RAM, etc) have to be procured. It also makes inter-thread\ncommunication very cheap, because (like in the case of shared memory), the\nthreads have to only pass pointers. As with any shared memory, this is also\ndangerous: controlling shared access to data is extremely challenging. Some\nsolutions synchronize access to data, so that only one thread has access to\nit at a time. This will slow down execution, as one thread will have to wait\nfor another, but it also can lead to deadlock, grinding the threads to a\nhalt.\nThe kernel will split CPU time for threads. In the best case, when there are\nas many CPUs as threads, each thread can have a dedicated CPU. More often,\nthe kernel will slice time on CPUs, scheduling and suspending threads\n(including threads from different processes). When a thread is suspended, the\nassociated registers (including stack pointers, program registers, etc) will\nhave to be saved, to be restored when the thread is re-scheduled. A common case\nis when a thread makes a blocking system call: it must wait, so another thread\nwill use its compute resources.\nIn addition to kernel threads, the process can create user threads (or green\nthreads), which are unknown to the kernel and managed entirely by the process.\nThese are very fast to create, and can be optimized for the process's specific\nneeds. However, the process must perform the complicated management of threads,\nincluding allocating stacks. Since the kernel only allocates CPU time to kernel\nthreads, user threads all have to share their process's access to the CPU.\nCPU Caches🔗\nComputing on data in a register takes 1 cycle (~1 nanosecond). Accessing RAM\ntakes the equivalent time to ~100 cycles. So every time a CPU needs to fetch\ndata from (or write data to) RAM, it has to idle for about 100 cycles. With\nthe architecture we described above, we won't get the benefits of the CPU\nspeedups of the last decade.\nCPU caches are small amounts of fast memory near the CPU to cache recently\nused data. Modern architectures use a cache hierarchy of successively larger\nand slower caches. The most common hierarchy has three levels, called L1,\nL2, and L3. Typical access times and cache sizes are given below.\nLevelCyclesSize\nRegister18 B\nL1464 kB\nL210256 kB\nL3408 MB\nRAM10010 GB\nSSD10^51 TB\n\nCurrent processors will often have separate L1 caches for instructions and\ndata. Also, each level cache will be shared by a different number of cores,\nCPUs, etc, and the chip needs to keep track of when to evict data from the\ncache, as well as when data might have been modified elsewhere and must be\ninvalidated. This is a rich and complicated subject, way beyond our scope\nhere.\nCaches are populated with cache lines, which are typically\naligned5 64 byte regions. Accessing any data in the line will\ncause the whole line to be cached. If you read a word at the beginning of a\ncache line, you can access the rest of the line almost for free. So if you\nhave an array of 8-byte integers contained in a contiguous block of memory, you\ncould iterate over it 8 times faster than if the integers were scattered in\nmemory (if they were boxed Java Longs, for example). Furthermore, the CPU will\ntry to predict the next data to be read, and pre-fetch that cache line, which\ncould lead to a 100x speedup.\nThe term for related data being together in RAM is termed data locality. The\neffect of caches is so significant that modern data structure and algorithm\ndesign considers data locality (and related concerns) to be on par with big-O\ncomplexity calculations. Loops over flat arrays may beat iterating over object\npointers even if traditional algorithmic analysis says otherwise. The term for\nalgorithms that are designed to efficiently use cache hierarchies are termed\ncache-oblivious algorithms. The non-intuitive name is because cache-aware\nalgorithms are designed for a specific cache hierarchy (with sizes and delays\nknown), and cache-oblivious algorithms are designed to work well in any\nhierarcy.\n5\nA chunk of data that is b bytes is said to be aligned if\nits address is a multiple of b. Aligned data is much faster for the CPU to\nload and use. Thus 8 byte integers should be stored at address like n * 8,\nbut not n * 8 - 4. 64 byte cache lines therefore start at addresses that\nare a multiple of 64.\n\nSummary🔗\nComputation is done on variables in the registers, which are very small,\nvery fast chunks of memory in the CPU. The system has a much larger, but much\nslower, region of memory called RAM, which must be moved to and from the\nregisters in order to be worked on. RAM is typically divided into the stack\nand the heap. The stack where variables local in scope to a\nsubroutine/function are stored; allocation and deallocation are fast and will\nnot cause memory leaks. The heap is a larger area of memory that much be\nmanaged more explicitly. Allocating on the heap requires knowing what parts of\nthe heap are in use, and finding space. Different languages deallocate\ndifferently, including manually (C, C++), garbage collecting (Java, Python,\netc), and having the compiler insert the commands automatically (Rust, ARC in\nObjC).\nMultiple processes are managed by the kernel, which allocates resources like\nRAM and CPU time.  It prevents processes from interfering with each other's\nmemory using virtual memory, which also allows secondary storage (like disks)\nto be used as an extension of RAM.  A process can have multiple threads, which\nare \"lightweight processes\" that share the same memory space, but can parallelize\ncomputation by slicing up time on multiple CPUs.\nBecause CPUs are so much faster than accessing RAM, a hierarchy of\nfast-but-small cpu caches (e.g., L1, L2, L3) are put in or near the\nCPU. Data is cached in proximate chunks, so accessing data near previously\naccessed data is faster than accessing distant memory.\nLearn More🔗\nJ Clark Scott: But How Do It Know?\nJacob Schrum on Virtual Memory, and other things\nBradlee Speice: Allocations in Rust\nWhy software developers should care about CPU caches\nScott Meyers: CPU Caches and Why You Care\n","id":"https://jagill.github.io/zola-test/computer-memory/","title":"A Primer on Computer Memory"},"https://jagill.github.io/zola-test/git-dag/":{"body":"Git is a powerful version control system, but the mental model can be\ncomplex. Beginners can find such concepts as fast-forward merges confusion,\nand sooner or later everyone ends up in the dreaded \"detached head\" mode.\nThis article will build up a mental model of Git to understand what's really\nhappening, ensuring that you're never trapped, and allowing you to perform\nimpressive feats of Git surgery with aplomb.\nGit commits as a DAG🔗\nThe fundamental object that we'll be talking about is a\ncommit1. A commit is the current state of the file tree, along\nwith some metadata. Some of this metadata is an author, and a message the\nauthor includes to explain the changes since the last commit. Another\nextremely important bit of metadata is the commit's parent commits. Most\ncommits have a single parent, which is the previous state of the file tree.\nSometimes, such as in a merge, a commit has multiple parents, since it\ninherits from and reconciles two or more different states. A fancy way of\nsaying this is that a git repo forms a Directed Acyclic Graph (or DAG), with\nthe commits as nodes, and the parent relationship being an arrow.\nBefore we get started, let's make some aliases that will make visualization\neasier.  Enter the following commands:\n$ git config --global alias.lol \"log --graph --decorate --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit\"\n$ git config --global alias.lola \"log --graph --decorate --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit --all\"\n\nAlso, make sure you have the latest version of git (as of this writing, 2.5.0).\nOn OS X, I suggest installing git via Homebrew.\nOur first commit🔗\nLet's make this concrete.  Make a new directory called git-dag-tutorial,\nenter it, and then initialize the git repository:\n$ mkdir git-dag-tutorial\n$ cd git-dag-tutorial\n$ git init\n$ git status\nOn branch master\n\nInitial commit\n\nnothing to commit (create/copy files and use \"git add\" to track)\n\nYou now have an empty repository; it doesn't even have a commit yet.  Let's\nmake our first commit.\n$ echo 'A0' &gt; a.txt # Make a file just containing 'A0'\n$ git add a.txt\n$ git commit -m 'A0'\n[master (root-commit) c32f318] A0\n 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\n create mode 100644 a.txt\n$ git lol\n* c32f318 (HEAD -&gt; master) A0\n$ A0=`git rev-parse HEAD`\n\nThe repo now has as a single commit,  and this commit is the only one that does\nnot have a parent.  This is an important property of a repo -- there is only\none 'root' commit, so if you trace back the ancestry of any commit, you will\neventually end up here.\nThe command git lol will show us the current commit (called HEAD), and its\nparent(s) recursively until we reach the root commit.  Try it now.  We only\nhave one commit, so it will just show that.  The first column is of the form\nc32f318...; the crazy hex number is called the commit hash.  It will\nbe different for everybody, so in the last line we just saved it in the\nenvironment variable A0.  Also, try git show HEAD; notice that it shows you\nthat same commit, with some more information on it.\nWe are also on a branch.  Type git branch, and notice it outputs * master.\nThis means we are on the master branch.  A branch is really just a pointer to\na given commit that keeps up as we create new commits.  Try git show master;\nnotice that it gives the same commit.  Actually, we were being inaccurate above;\nin reality HEAD doesn't point to our first commit A0, it points to master which\nthen points to A0.  This is shown in the output of git lol; a single commit,\nwith a hash that we'll represent by A0, that is pointed to by branch master.\nHEAD in turns points to master.\nIt's important to understand the difference between when HEAD pointing to\nmaster which points to A0, and when both HEAD and master point to A0\nseparately.  We can get to the latter state by:\n$ git checkout $A0 # This will use the last commit above.\n$ git lol\n* c32f318 (HEAD, master) A0\n\ngit checkout roughly means \"move HEAD to the given place, and change the\nfilesystem to match HEAD.\"\nNotice that when you did the checkout, you got a scary message about being in\n'detached HEAD' state.  Many people are afraid of this cryptic message, but you now\nknow what it means.  We can easily escape it by typing git checkout master,\nwhich puts us back in our earlier, safer, state.  Do that now:\n$ git checkout master\nBranching🔗\nLet's add to our file.\n$ echo 'A1' &gt;&gt; a.txt # Add the line 'A1'; make sure you have double brackets!\n$ git commit a.txt -m 'A1'\n[master 0c5a853] A1\n 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\n$ git lol\n* 0c5a853 (HEAD -&gt; master) A1\n* c32f318 A0\n\nThe order means that A0 is the parent of A1.\nNotice that master has moved up to the new commit A1, dragging HEAD up with\nit.  Had we been in the 'detached HEAD' mode above when we made our commit,\nour graph would look like:\n$ git lol\n* 0c5a853 (HEAD) A1\n* c32f318 (master) A0\n\nIn this case, if we committed in the detached HEAD state, we would have\nleft branch master behind.  Being on a branch means the branch moves with us.\nNow let's experiment with branching!\n$ git branch dev\n$ git branch\n  dev\n* master\n$ git lol\n* 0c5a853 (HEAD -&gt; master, dev) A1\n* c32f318 A0\n\nThe first command makes a branch, pointed at our current commit, and the second\ncommand shows the branches, putting an * before the branch HEAD is pointing\nto.  Notice that in the log, we see that both master and dev point to A1,\nand HEAD points to master.\nNow let's switch branches:\n$ git checkout dev\n$ git branch\n* dev\n  master\n$ git lol\n* 0c5a853 (HEAD -&gt; dev, master) A1\n* c32f318 A0\n\nHEAD is now pointing to branch dev.\nNow let's make another commit:\n$ echo 'B2' &gt; b.txt\n$ git add b.txt\n$ git commit -m 'B2'\n$ git lol\n* 4e7b4c1 (HEAD -&gt; dev) B2\n* 0c5a853 (master) A1\n* c32f318 A0\n\nChecking git lol shows three commits; the most recent we'll call B2.\nNotice master is still pointed at A1, while dev (and HEAD) is pointed\nat B2.  Let's go back to master to see where we are:\n$ git checkout master\n$ ls\n$ git lol\n* 0c5a853 (HEAD -&gt; master) A1\n* c32f318 A0\n\nNotice that there is only the file a.txt, and the log only shows A1 and A0,\nwhich is what we expect.  When we are\npointing at a commit, we can only get information about its ancestors, not\nits descendants.  This is an important enough point that we'll put it in\nbold: A commit knows everything about its ancestors, and nothing about\nits descendants 2.\nWe can see the graph with all the branches by\n$ git lola\n* 4e7b4c1 (dev) B2\n* 0c5a853 (HEAD -&gt; master) A1\n* c32f318 A0\n\nLet's make an additional commit on master.\n$ echo 'A2' &gt; a.txt\n$ git commit a.txt -m 'A2'\n$ git lol\n* 93f50b6 (HEAD -&gt; master) A2\n* 0c5a853 A1\n* c32f318 A0\n\nWe can see how master and dev relate:\n$ git lola\n* 93f50b6 (HEAD -&gt; master) A2\n| * 4e7b4c1 (dev) B2\n|/\n* 0c5a853 A1\n* c32f318 A0\n\nOur branches have diverged!  The parent of both A2 and B2 is A1, but A2 and B2\ndon't know anything about each other.\nMerging🔗\nHow does merging fit into this picture?  Merging two branches makes a commit\nthat has the tip of each branch as parents.\n$ git merge dev\n$ git lol\n*   eb328ca (HEAD -&gt; master) A3\n|\\\n| * 4e7b4c1 (dev) B2\n* | 93f50b6 A2\n|/\n* 0c5a853 A1\n* c32f318 A0\n\nNotice that dev is still pointing to B2, but master now points to a commit\nA3 that has both A2 and B2 as parents.  Now that dev has been merged into\nmaster, master knows all about dev and its history.\nWhat's up with dev?\n$ git checkout dev\n$ git lol\n* 4e7b4c1 (HEAD -&gt; dev) B2\n* 0c5a853 A1\n* c32f318 A0\n$ git merge master\n$ git lol\n*   eb328ca (HEAD -&gt; dev, master) A3\n|\\\n| * 4e7b4c1 B2\n* | 93f50b6 A2\n|/\n* 0c5a853 A1\n* c32f318 A0\n\nNotice that this merge didn't make a new commit, it just moved dev to point\nat A3; this is called a 'fast-forward' merge.  This is another very important\npoint: By default, if a merge can be accomplished by moving a branch to an\nexisting commit that satisfies the merge, it will do this.\nYou can also add the --no-ff flag to a merge, which forces it to not\nfast-forward.  Had we done that, the commits would be\n*   d85fcb6 (HEAD -&gt; dev) B3\n|\\\n| *   eb328ca (master) A3\n| |\\\n| |/\n|/|\n* | 4e7b4c1 B2\n| * 93f50b6 A2\n|/\n* 0c5a853 A1\n* c32f318 A0\n\nThis makes the commit tree more complex, but keeps an explicit record of the\nmerge.\nConclusion🔗\nNow you understand, at a commit level, what's happening when you branch and\nmerge.  It might be fruitful to experiment with committing, branching,\nmerging, detaching HEAD, git reset, and more, checking with git lol and\ngit lola to see the commit tree.\nFootnotes🔗\n1\nCommits are made up of blobs and trees, which are more fundamental, but\nwe'll not go down to that level.\n\n2\nIn fact, a commit that has nothing pointing to it is\nconsidered garbage, and will be cleaned up and deleted by git in about 30 days.\n\n","id":"https://jagill.github.io/zola-test/git-dag/","title":"Git Commit Dag"},"https://jagill.github.io/zola-test/git-remote/":{"body":"Git's power is in collaboration, and that comes from remote branches.\nEveryone's used a remote branch, but juggling multiple remotes and keeping\nlocal and remote branches in sync can be challenging. Here, we explain how\nremote branches work, how to manage them effectively, and how to set one up\nyourself.\n\nWe assume you understand local git commits. Now let's talk\nabout remote branches, which is how we unlock the power of distributed\nversion control. There are a couple important concepts that we will talk more\nabout later, but the terminology of local and remote branches and repos can\nbe a bit confusing, so let's introduce them now:\n\nLocal repository: This is a git repo on your local machine -- it's what\nyou get when you clone another repo.\nLocal branch: A local branch is the branch you are used to. It lives\nin your local repo (on your machine), and you can commit to it via the normal\nworkflow.\nRemote repository: A remote repository (usually just called remote) is a\nrepository different than your local repository that your local repo is\ntracking.  It may have local branches, just like your local repo.  You can\npull from a remote repo, which will bring the local branches of the remote\nrepo into the remote branches of your local repo (we'll explain that later).\nRemote branch: A remote branch is a local copy of a branch on a remote\nrepo. It will be shown in git branch --all as REMOTE/BRANCH.  These\ntrack the local branches of remote repos.\n\nNB: We've abbreviated the output of the fetch and push subcommands\nfor clarity.\nRemote Repositories🔗\nEvery git repo -- including the local one on your machine -- is a complete\nrepo, with all the commit history back to the root commit.  This includes the\nbranches (which are just pointers to a given commit).  The branches consist\nof at least master, but often several others.  A fundamental operation in\ngit is to clone a repository, which makes a local repository by copying all of\nthe commit history from another repository (eg, one on GitHub).  Usually this\n\"remote\" repo is on another machine, but you can clone any repo with a valid\ngit URL, including one on your own machine.  We'll do that for the tutorial,\nbut normally this repo would be somewhere else.  Let's make the \"remote\" repo.\ntmp/ $ mkdir git-remote\ntmp/ $ cd git-remote\ngit-remote/ $ git init --bare remote\ngit-remote/ $ ls\nremote/\n\nWe've created a special kind of repo called a \"bare\" (or \"headless\") repo.\nIt does not have a HEAD pointer, so it's not a place you can directly\ndo work or commit to, but it can get commits from other places (as we will\ndo shortly).\nNow let's clone it to a \"local\" repo.  This will make a \"downstream\" repo; one\nthat will track the changes in the \"upstream\" (remote) repo.\ngit-remote/ $ git clone remote local1\nCloning into 'local1'...\ndone.\ngit-remote/ $ ls\nlocal1/  remote/\n\nIn the git clone command, remote is the URL of the \"parent\" repo (in this\ncase, just a directory), and local1 is the path of the local repo.  Notice\nthat it makes a directory named local1.  Let's make a commit and push it to\nthe remote.\ngit-remote/ $ cd local1\nlocal1/ $ echo 'A1' &gt; a.txt\nlocal1/ $ git add a.txt\nlocal1/ $ git commit -m 'A1'\nlocal1/ $ git log --oneline --decorate --all\ncdf451e (HEAD -&gt; master) A1\nlocal1/ $ git push\nTo /tmp/git-remote/remote\n * [new branch]      master -&gt; master\nlocal1/ $ git log --oneline --decorate --all\n* cdf451e (HEAD -&gt; master, origin/master) A1\n\nNote that after we pushed, a new branch appeared, origin/master.  This is a\nremote branch, which tracks a local branch on a remote repository.\nWhat happened in the remote repo?\nlocal1/ $ cd ../remote\nremote/ $ git log --oneline --decorate --all\ncdf451e (HEAD -&gt; master) A1\n\nThe commit is now in the remote branch, as is the master branch.  Let's clone\nit to a new local branch.\nremote/ $ cd ..\ngit-remote/ $ git clone remote local2\nCloning into 'local2'...\ndone.\ngit-remote/ $ cd local2\nlocal2/ $ git log --oneline --decorate --all\n* cdf451e (HEAD -&gt; master, origin/master, origin/HEAD) A1\n\nThe new repo has all the commits that the remote repo has.  Let's make a change\nhere, and see what happens on local1.\nlocal2/ $ echo A2 &gt;&gt; a.txt\nlocal2/ $ git commit a.txt -m \"A2\"\n[master c65a734] A2\n 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\nlocal2/ $ git push\nTo /tmp/git-remote/remote\n   cdf451e..c65a734  master -&gt; master\nlocal2/ $ cd ../remote\n* c65a734 (HEAD -&gt; master) A2\n* cdf451e A1\nremote/ $ cd ../local1\nlocal1/ $ git log --oneline --decorate --all\n* cdf451e (HEAD -&gt; master, origin/master) A1\n\nWhile the changes are in the remote repo, they are not yet in local1.  We\ncan fetch these changes:\nlocal1/ $ git fetch\nlocal1/ $ git log --oneline --decorate --all\n* c65a734 (origin/master) A2\n* cdf451e (HEAD -&gt; master) A1\n\nNow we have the new commit, but our local master doesn't point to it.  We see\nthe remote branch origin/master points to the new commit; we can merge that\ninto our local master:\nlocal1/ $ git merge origin/master\nUpdating cdf451e..c65a734\nFast-forward\n a.txt | 1 +\n 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\nlocal1/ $ git log --oneline --decorate --all\n* c65a734 (HEAD -&gt; master, origin/master) A2\n* cdf451e A1\n\nNow our branches, as well as our commits, are the same on local1 and local2.\nSince this operation is performed so frequently, there's a shortcut command for\nit: git pull.  It will perform a git fetch, then a\ngit merge origin/CURRENT_BRANCH.  If your current branch doesn't have a\nremote tracking branch, it will return an error.\nThe fetch/merge/pull distinction is an important one, so we'll emphasize\nit here:\n\ngit fetch fetches all the commits from the remote repo to the local repo,\nand updates the remote branches.\ngit merge can merge a remote branch into a local one.\ngit pull is a shortcut that fetches and then merges a remote tracking branch\ninto the current local one.\n\nMultiple Branches🔗\nOne common point of confusion arises when people want to push a local branch to\na remote repo.  Conceptually, you often want to create a new branch on origin\nwith the same name as your local branch, and have your local branch track this\nbranch.  The default option in git does not do this, which sometimes leads to\nconfusion.  Let's do it the wrong way first.\nlocal1/ $ git checkout -b dev\nSwitched to a new branch 'dev'\nlocal1/ $ echo B1 &gt; b.txt\nlocal1/ $ git add b.txt\nlocal1/ $ git commit -m \"B1\"\n[dev ade622a] B1\n 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\n create mode 100644 b.txt\n\nlocal1/ $ git branch -vv # This should any upstream branches\n* dev    ade622a\n  master c65a734 [origin/master] A2\n\nlocal1/ $ git push\nfatal: The current branch dev has no upstream branch.\nTo push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use\n\n    git push --set-upstream origin dev\n\nlocal1/ $ git push origin dev # Notice we did not include --set-upstream\nTo /tmp/git-remote/remote\n * [new branch]      dev -&gt; dev\n\nlocal1/ $ git pull\nThere is no tracking information for the current branch.\nPlease specify which branch you want to merge with.\nSee git-pull(1) for details\n\n    git pull &lt;remote&gt; &lt;branch&gt;\n\nIf you wish to set tracking information for this branch you can do so with:\n\n    git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/&lt;branch&gt; dev\n\nlocal1/ $ git branch -vv # Notice still no upstream branch\n* dev    ade622a\n  master c65a734 [origin/master] A2\n\nlocal1/ $ git push --set-upstream origin dev\nBranch dev set up to track remote branch dev from origin.\n\nlocal1/ $ git branch -vv # There's the upstream branch!\n* dev    ade622a [origin/dev] B1\n  master c65a734 [origin/master] A2\n\nlocal1/ $ git pull\nAlready up-to-date.\n\nNotice that we can't push without arguments, because git does not know what to\ndo with this new branch.  We can tell it specifically which remote and which branch\nto push to, but unless we tell it to set that remote branch as an upstream\ntracking branch, it doesn't know that we want to keep those branches in sync.\nAs a side note, git branch [-v, --v] is a useful tool to display what git knows\nabout your branches.\nNow that the dev is tracking origin/dev, commits by either local repo can\nbe transferred to the other.\nlocal1/ $ cd ../local2\nlocal2/ $ git branch -a\n* master\n  remotes/origin/HEAD -&gt; origin/master\n  remotes/origin/master\nlocal2/ $ git fetch\nFrom /Users/jag/tmp/git-remote2/remote\n * [new branch]      dev        -&gt; origin/dev\nlocal2/ $ git branch -a\n* master\n  remotes/origin/HEAD -&gt; origin/master\n  remotes/origin/dev\n  remotes/origin/master\nlocal2/ $ git log --oneline --decorate --all\n* ade622a (origin/dev) B1\n* c65a734 (HEAD -&gt; master, origin/master, origin/HEAD) A2\n* cdf451e A1\nlocal2/ $ git checkout dev\nBranch dev set up to track remote branch dev from origin.\nSwitched to a new branch 'dev'\nlocal2/ $ git log --oneline --decorate --all\n* ade622a (HEAD -&gt; dev, origin/dev) B1\n* c65a734 (origin/master, origin/HEAD, master) A2\n* cdf451e A1\n\nNow we can work on branch dev in local2.\nlocal2/ $ echo B2 &gt;&gt; b.txt\nlocal2/ $ git commit b.txt -m 'B2'\n[dev 73a9efd] B2\n 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\nlocal2/ $ git push\nTo /Users/jag/tmp/git-remote2/remote\n   ade622a..73a9efd  dev -&gt; dev\nlocal2/ $ cd ../local1\nlocal1/ $ git log --oneline --decorate --all\n* ade622a (HEAD -&gt; dev, origin/dev) B1\n* c65a734 (origin/master, master) A2\n* cdf451e A1\nlocal1/ $ git pull\nFrom /Users/jag/tmp/git-remote2/remote\n   ade622a..73a9efd  dev        -&gt; origin/dev\nUpdating ade622a..73a9efd\nFast-forward\n b.txt | 1 +\n 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\nlocal1/ $ git log --oneline --decorate --all\n* 73a9efd (HEAD -&gt; dev, origin/dev) B2\n* ade622a (origin/temp) B1\n* c65a734 (origin/master, master) A2\n* cdf451e A1\n\nNow people working in two different local branches can coordinate through a\nremote branch.\nMultiple Remotes🔗\nThe flow we just described is called the 'centralized' workflow, because\nall commits are going through a single, central, remote repository.  However,\ngit was designed first and foremost to be a distributed system, allowing\npeople to manage commits from many remotes.\nOne of the main ways that people use this is for pull requests.  If someone\nwishes to contribute to your repository, they will often fork it, push changes\nto their remote repository, and let you review the changes before you decide\nto merge them into your branch.  Let's do that for our two users, local1\nand local2.\nFirst let's create and set up another remote, called remote2.\nlocal2/ $ cd ..\ngit-remote/ $ git clone --bare remote/ remote2/\nCloning into bare repository 'remote2'...\ndone.\ngit-remote/ $ cd local2\nlocal2/ $ git remote\norigin\nlocal2/ $ git remote add remote2 ../remote2\nlocal2/ $ git remote\norigin\nremote2\nlocal2/ $ git fetch remote2 # fetch by default uses origin\nFrom ../remote2\n * [new branch]      dev        -&gt; remote2/dev\n * [new branch]      master     -&gt; remote2/master\n\nWe've cloned another remote off of our original remote repository, and added it\nas a remote for local2.  Let's push a change to the dev branch of remote2,\nso that local1 can review the changes.\nlocal2/ $ git checkout dev\nlocal2/ $ echo B3 &gt;&gt; b.txt\nlocal2/ $ git commit b.txt -m 'B3'\n[dev c992ab9] B3\n 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\nlocal2/ $ git push remote2 dev\nTo ../remote2\n   73a9efd..c992ab9  dev -&gt; dev\nlocal2/ $ git log --oneline --decorate --all\n* c992ab9 (HEAD -&gt; dev, remote2/dev) B3\n* 73a9efd (origin/dev) B2\n* ade622a B1\n* c65a734 (remote2/master, origin/master, origin/HEAD, master) A2\n* cdf451e A1\n\nNotice that we have remote branches for both remote repos.  When we pushed, we\nneeded to explicitly set the remote and the branch to push to, because the\nlocal branch dev is set to track origin/dev, which is supplied as a default\nif we just use git push.  Since we don't want to push to the default, we need\nto be explicit.\nLet's go to local1 and pull these changes to another branch, review the diffs,\nand merge them.\nlocal2/ $ cd ../local1\nlocal1/ $ git remote add remote2 ../remote2\nlocal1/ $ git fetch remote2\nFrom ../remote2\n * [new branch]      dev        -&gt; remote2/dev\n * [new branch]      master     -&gt; remote2/master\nlocal1/ $ git log --oneline --decorate --all\n* c992ab9 (remote2/dev) B3\n* 73a9efd (HEAD -&gt; dev, origin/dev) B2\n* ade622a (origin/temp) B1\n* c65a734 (remote2/master, origin/master, master) A2\n* cdf451e A1\n\nSo now we have the new code in the remote branch remote2/dev.  Let's make\na branch that tracks it, so that we can see the changes.\nlocal1/ $ git branch dev2 remote2/dev\nBranch dev2 set up to track remote branch dev from remote2.\nlocal1/ $ git lola\n* c992ab9 (remote2/dev, dev2) B3\n* 73a9efd (HEAD -&gt; dev, origin/dev) B2\n* ade622a (origin/temp) B1\n* c65a734 (remote2/master, origin/master, master) A2\n* cdf451e A1\nlocal1/ $ git checkout dev2\nSwitched to branch 'dev2'\nYour branch is up-to-date with 'remote2/dev'.\n\nFirst, we create a local branch dev2 which tracks the remote branch remote2/dev, and then checked it out.  If we wanted to modify it\nand push those changes upstream, we could.  Or, we can merge it into\nour local version of dev, and push those changes upstream to\norigin/dev:\nlocal1/ $ git checkout dev\nSwitched to branch 'dev'\nYour branch is up-to-date with 'origin/dev'.\nlocal1/ $ git merge dev2\nUpdating 73a9efd..c992ab9\nFast-forward\n b.txt | 1 +\n 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\nlocal1/ $ git push\nTo /Users/jag/tmp/git-remote2/remote\n   73a9efd..c992ab9  dev -&gt; dev\n\nNow these changes can be seen by local2, as normal.\nSummary🔗\nWe've seen that each repo is a complete record of the codebase.  Local repos\nare where people make modifications, and remote repos are places that changes\ncan be distributed to others.  The most common model is the centralized model,\nwhere everyone shares a single remote repo.  Another model is distributed, and\nin the extreme case every person has their own remote repo that they can push\nchanges to, and that others can pull from.\nA local repo has both local branches, and remote branches which track the\n\"local\" branches of the remote repos.  A branch can \"track\" another branch,\nwhich means when the upstream (tracked) has changes, \"pull\" will merge\nthose changes into the downstream (tracking) branch, and a \"push\" will merge\nchanges from the downstream branch to the upstream.\n","id":"https://jagill.github.io/zola-test/git-remote/","title":"Git Remote Branches"},"https://jagill.github.io/zola-test/git-reset/":{"body":"An important part of version control is the ability to go back to previous \nstates -- particularly if your recent changes messed something up!  Git\nhas the powerful reset command, but it has a bewildering array of\nslightly-but-crucially-different modes.  People generally start out memorizing\na couple reset commands for common tasks, but still have questions like\n\"what does git reset --soft do anyway?\".  In this article, we'll build up\na mental model of how Git views changes, which will allow us to unlock the full\npower of reset.\n\ngit-reset has several options, and using it effectively requires\nunderstanding some fundamental concepts in git: HEAD, the index, and the\nworking tree. Underlying all of these is the familiar concept of the\nfiletree; this is just the files and directories under the root of the git\nrepo.\nThe four stages of commitment🔗\nAn important conceptual model to have in our mind is the four stages changes go\nthrough in the git commit process.  We'll find that the the various options\nof git reset differ primarily in how they move around these four stages of\ncommitment.  These are the file tree, the working tree, the index, and HEAD.\n\nThe file tree is just the changes that are on disk; this is the familiar\nnon-git concept.\nThe working tree is those changes to the file tree that git knows about.  Any\nchanges to the file tree in a file that is tracked by git are automatically\nknown, and thus on the working tree.\nThe index is those changes that are staged to be included in the next commit.\nChanges are generally moved from the working tree to the index by git add.\nHEAD is the commit you are currently on.\n\nWe'll give examples for those four in a second, but let's talk about git diff\nand git status.  When you use git diff, it shows the differences between\nthe index and the working tree.  Thus it does not show staged changes.  Using\ngit diff --staged (alias: git diff --cached) shows the differences between\nHEAD and the index.\nThe command git status will show you what files have\nchanges in the index (staged changes, under \"Changes to be committed:\"),\nchanges in the working tree but not in the index (unstaged cahnges, under\n\"Changes not staged for commit:\"), and files that are not known to git\n(under \"Untracked files:\").  Note that it's quite possible for a given file\nto have both staged and unstaged changes (see below).\nIn this tutorial when we use git status or git diff, we abbreviate the\noutput for brevity.  The actual output you see will be more verbose.\nThe index and working tree🔗\nFirst let's review the index and the working tree, which are necessary to\nunderstand git reset.  If you feel very comfortable with them, feel free to\nbreeze through this section, just setting up the commits.  We'll use those\ncommits in the discussion of git-reset below.\nThe index🔗\nThe index is a staging area where changes are held before they are committed.\nLet's see it in action in a simple scenario.\n$ mkdir git-reset &amp;&amp; cd git-reset\n$ git init\nInitialized empty Git repository in /Users/jag/tmp/git-reset/.git/\n$ echo \"A1\" &gt; a.txt\n$ git status\nUntracked files:\n\ta.txt\n$ git diff\n\nIn terms of the four stages, we have:\nA1 &lt; filetree\nNULL &lt; HEAD, index, worktree\n\n(An initialized git repo starts with no commits, so HEAD is not defined).\nAt this point, we have a single untracked file.  By definition, this file is\nin the filetree, but git has no knowledge of it yet.   That's why git diff\ndoes not tell us about the changes to a.txt. As soon as git knows\nabout it, it is considered in the working tree; and git helpfully tells us\nto add it:\n$ git add a.txt\n$ git status\nChanges to be committed:\n\tnew file:   a.txt\n$ git diff\n\nSo now git knows about it, but why did git diff still return nothing?\nBecause the a.txt is actually in the index.  The index is like a\n'commit-in-waiting'; by adding changes you are building up what will be the\nnext commit.  We can check the diff with the --staged option:\n$ git diff --staged\nnew file mode 100644\n--- /dev/null\n+++ b/a.txt\n+A1\n\nIn terms of our four stages, we have:\nA1 &lt; index, worktree, filetree\nNULL &lt; HEAD\n\nThere's a lot of information here, but we can see that it's a new file, and\nthe contents are the expected 'A1'.  Let's commit it.\n$ git commit -m 'A1'\n[master (root-commit) 5b2c703] A1\n 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\n create mode 100644 a.txt\n$ git status # Nothing here after commit\n$ A1=`git rev-parse HEAD`\n\nThe last line just stores the current commit hash in a variable we'll use\nlater.  The details aren't important, but if you want to know more you can\ngit help rev-parse.\nThe four stages are now all pointing to the same commit:\nA1 &lt; HEAD, index, worktree, filetree\nThe working tree🔗\nWe can think of HEAD, the index, and the working tree as accumulating the\nchanges we are making to the file tree.  Now that we have commited A1,\nHEAD, the index, and the working tree are all up-to-date with the file tree.\nNow that a.txt is known to git, changes to it show up in the working tree.\n$ echo 'A2' &gt;&gt; a.txt\n$ git status\nChanges not staged for commit:\n\tmodified:   a.txt\n$ git diff\n--- a/a.txt\n+++ b/a.txt\n A1\n+A2\n\nNow our picture looks like:\nA2 &lt; worktree, filetree\nA1 &lt; HEAD, index\n\nAdding a.txt moves the changes from the working tree to the index:\n$ git add a.txt\n$ git status\nChanges to be committed:\n\tmodified:   a.txt\n$ git diff\n$ git diff --staged\n--- a/a.txt\n+++ b/a.txt\n A1\n+A2\n\nNow our picture looks like:\nA2 &lt; index, worktree, filetree\nA1 &lt; HEAD\n\nThe changes no longer appear in git diff, just in git diff --staged.  If we\nchange a.txt again, the new changes are not in the index, just the working tree.\n$ echo 'A3' &gt;&gt; a.txt\n$ git status\nChanges to be committed:\n\tmodified:   a.txt\nChanges not staged for commit:\n\tmodified:   a.txt\n$ git diff\n--- a/a.txt\n+++ b/a.txt\n A1\n A2\n+A3\n$ git diff --staged\n--- a/a.txt\n+++ b/a.txt\n A1\n+A2\n\nOur stages are:\nA3 &lt; worktree, filetree\nA2 &lt; index\nA1 &lt; HEAD\n\nNotice that git diff --staged has not changed, but the new changes are in\ngit diff.  Now if we commit, we just commit the things in the index.\n$ git commit -m 'A2'\n[master cdd1bff] A2\n 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\n$ git status --short\nChanges not staged for commit:\n\tmodified:   a.txt\n$ A2=`git rev-parse HEAD`\n\nThe index changes are gone, but the working tree is left unchanged.  Note that\nthe file tree is unchanged; we've just been catching the commits up to the index.\nA3 &lt; worktree, filetree\nA2 &lt; HEAD, index\nA1\n\nLastly, let's commit the last changes so that we are positioned to explore\ngit reset.\n$ git add a.txt\n# A3 &lt; index, worktree, filetree\n# A2 &lt; HEAD\n$ git commit -m 'A3'\n[master 813395c] A3\n 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\n$ A3=`git rev-parse HEAD`\n\nNow everything is pointed at A3!\nA3 &lt; HEAD, index, worktree, filetree\nA2\nA1\nThe many flavors of git reset🔗\nThe reset command takes a bewildering number of forms and options.  We'll\nattempt to demystify these.  The fundamental principal is that git reset\nmoves HEAD to the commit specified, and the options control what happens\nto the index, working tree, and file tree.\nhard reset🔗\nLet's start with git reset --hard.  This is the simplest to understand,\nbecause it moves all four stages to the designated commit.\n$ git log --oneline --decorate\n813395c (HEAD -&gt; master) A3\ncdd1bff A2\n5b2c703 A1\n$ git reset --hard $A2\n$ git log --oneline --decorate\ncdd1bff (HEAD -&gt; master) A2\n5b2c703 A1\n$ cat a.txt\nA1\nA2\n\nNow we have\nA3\nA2 &lt; HEAD, index, worktree, filetree\nA1\n\nUsing git reset --hard COMMIT tells git to make all files that it knows\nabout into the form expected by COMMIT.  Note that it doesn't touch any\nuntracked files.\nSoft and Mixed🔗\nMake sure you are on the A3 commit:\n$ git reset --hard $A3\n\nOur four stages are:\nA3 &lt; HEAD, index, worktree, filetree\nA2\nA1\n\nWhen you git reset --soft COMMIT, it resets HEAD to point to COMMIT, but\nleaves the index, working tree, and file tree unchanged.\n$ git reset --soft $A2\nChanges to be committed:\n\tmodified:   a.txt\n$ git diff --staged\n--- a/a.txt\n+++ b/a.txt\n A1\n A2\n+A3\n$ git log --oneline --decorate\ncdd1bff (HEAD -&gt; master) A2\n5b2c703 A1\n\nWe've moved HEAD back to the A2 commit.  Notice that a.txt is in the index.\nWe have\nA3 &lt; index, worktree, filetree\nA2 &lt; HEAD\nA1\n\nInstead, if we had used git reset --mixed, we'd have left the changes in the\nworking tree.  (Note that --mixed is the default level, so git reset is\nequivalent to git reset --mixed).\n$ git reset --hard $A3\n$ git reset --mixed $A2\nUnstaged changes after reset:\nM\ta.txt\n$ git status\nChanges not staged for commit:\n\tmodified:   a.txt\n$ git diff\n--- a/a.txt\n+++ b/a.txt\n A1\n A2\n+A3\n$ git log --oneline --decorate\ncdd1bff (HEAD -&gt; master) A2\n5b2c703 A1\n\nWe have\nA3 &lt; worktree, filetree\nA2 &lt; HEAD, index\nA1\n\nNow let's combine the two, to show their difference more clearly.  From the\nabove state, we can use git reset --soft:\n$ git reset --soft $A1\n$ git status\nChanges to be committed:\n\tmodified:   a.txt\nChanges not staged for commit:\n\tmodified:   a.txt\n$ git diff\n--- a/a.txt\n+++ b/a.txt\n A1\n A2\n+A3\n$ git diff --staged\n--- a/a.txt\n+++ b/a.txt\n A1\n+A2\n$ git log --oneline --decorate\n5b2c703 (HEAD -&gt; master) A1\n\nWe have\nA3 &lt; worktree, filetree\nA2 &lt; index\nA1 &lt; HEAD\n\nNow that we understand the difference between --soft, --mixed, and\n--hard, let's get back to A3:\n$ git reset --hard $A3\nreset vs checkout🔗\nWhile both git reset and git checkout change where HEAD is pointing, they\ndo this in fundamentally different ways.  git checkout moves HEAD to\npoint to the given branch (or commit-ish), without moving any branches.\ngit reset instead moves the active branch (pointed to by HEAD) to the supplied\ncommit-ish, dragging HEAD along with it.  In other words, git checkout switches\nwhat you are working on, while git reset modifies what you are working on.\n$ git checkout --branch dev\n$ git log --oneline --decorate --all\n* 1fd9bf6 (HEAD -&gt; dev, master) A3\n* ad01fba A2\n* 3162ad7 A1\n\n$ echo B1 &gt;&gt; b.txt\n$ git add b.txt\n$ git commit -m \"B1\"\n$ git log --oneline --decorate --all\n* b0e3450 (HEAD -&gt; dev) B1\n* 1fd9bf6 (master) A3\n* ad01fba A2\n* 3162ad7 A1\n\n$ git checkout master\n$ git log --oneline --decorate --all\n* b0e3450 (dev) B1\n* 1fd9bf6 (HEAD -&gt; master) A3\n* ad01fba A2\n* 3162ad7 A1\n\nNotice that the dev branch does not change, only the position of HEAD.\nContrast this with when you reset:\n$ git checkout dev\n$ git log --oneline --decorate --all\n* b0e3450 (HEAD -&gt; dev) B1\n* 1fd9bf6 (master) A3\n* ad01fba A2\n* 3162ad7 A1\n\n$ git reset master\n$ git log --oneline --decorate --all\n* 1fd9bf6 (HEAD -&gt; dev, master) A3\n* ad01fba A2\n* 3162ad7 A1\n\n$ git reset b0e3450\n$ git log --oneline --decorate --all\n* b0e3450 (HEAD -&gt; dev) B1\n* 1fd9bf6 (master) A3\n* ad01fba A2\n* 3162ad7 A1\n\nWhen you reset, you move the branch as well.\nSummary🔗\nWe've seen the four stages of commitment, namely filetree, working tree, index,\nand HEAD.  The reset command conceptually moves those four stages; this in\nturn might affect the content of files or whether changes are staged or\ncommitted.  It can be useful to undo work, or to get the filetree/index in\nthe appropriate state.\nIt differs at a fundamental from the checkout command, even though\nsometimes their effects look similar. The checkout command doesn't affect the\nunderlying commits, only where HEAD is pointing; you cannot lose committed\ndata, only move along the commit DAG. The reset command changes state at a\nmore fundamental level (especially the --hard option); you can undo work\nand modify the commit DAG, even removing commits from it.\n","id":"https://jagill.github.io/zola-test/git-reset/","title":"Git Reset"},"https://jagill.github.io/zola-test/pages/":{"body":"","id":"https://jagill.github.io/zola-test/pages/","title":""},"https://jagill.github.io/zola-test/presto-connectors/":{"body":"Presto is a SQL query engine, one that ultimately understands how to consume one\nor more input streams of rows and produce an output stream of rows.  At its\ncore, it doesn't understand things like datastores, disk IO, primary keys, and\npartitions.  To be practically useful, it needs to be able to connect to\ndatastores, which it does via connectors.  A connector is specific to a\nparticular datastore (say, MySQL, Hive, Cassandra, etc), and is what understands\nconcepts such as disk IO, partitions, etc.\n\nThis is part 2 of 5 of a series on Presto:\n\nPresto Overview\nPresto Connectors\nPresto Map-Reduce\nPresto Joins\nPresto Data-Flow\n\nPresto Storage Model🔗\nWhile Presto doesn't know about datastores, it has a set of abstractions that it\nexpects a connector to respect.\n\nRow: A row is a named tuple, and is the basic unit of data.\nSplit: A split is one or more rows, yielded as a unit for performance.  A\ntable will contain one or more splits.\nTable: A table is the basic storage concept in Presto.  They consist of\na number of (unordered) rows grouped into one or more splits.  They are\nfamilar concepts in SQL databases and Hive, although they can be applied to\nCSV files or anything else that can generate rows.\nSchema: Collections of tables are grouped into schemas.  A schema is\nequivalent to a database in the SQL or Hive world, but it could also be a\ndirectory of CSV files.  Anything that can be a logical collection of\ntables can be a schema.\nCatalog: A catalog is a collection of schemas.  A database cluster is\nan example.  Each catalog has one connector, so the schemas must be of the\nsame datastore type.\n\nA warehouse that had both MySQL and Hive clusters would need (at minimum) two\ncatalogs, one for MySQL and one for Hive.  While each catalog has one connector,\nit's possible that two catalogs can use the same connector type to access the\nsame datastore type. Consider the case where there are separate clusters for\nuser-facing MySQL databases and warehouse MySQL databases.  You could make two\ncatalogs, user-mysql and warehouse-mysql, each of which uses the MySQL\nconnector, initialized with different parameters.\nA fully-qualified table name is of the form {catalog}.{schema}.{table}, like\nhive.warehouse.dim_orders or mysql.user_data.addresses.  A given Presto\nsession can set default catalogs and schemas, allowing just the table name to be\nused.\nConnectors🔗\nWhen Presto wants data from a table, it looks up the connector specified for the\ncatalog.  The connector is specific to a given datasource, for example the MySQL\nconnector or the Hive connector.\nA table is grouped into data chunks called splits.  Presto queries the\nconnector, which reports how many splits are available.  This is used to plan\nthe query and determine parallelization.  The connector reads the table, sending\nthe splits to the appropriate workers to be processed.\nDelegating Predicates🔗\nThe most naive connector would read the entire table, yielding all splits.\nHowever, if the query has filter predicates like WHERE country = 'DE', Presto\ncan delegate the predicate to the connector.  The connector can filter these\nrows before sending them to the workers, reducing unneeded network IO and\ncomputation.  Futhermore, if the connector has understanding of things such as\nprimary keys, indices, partitions, etc, it can use the optimizations build into\nthe datastore to be even more efficient.\nOne effect of this is that two conditions that might be logically equivalent may\nbe result in dramatically different performance.  If the predicate is of a form\nthat is understood by the connector, it can do the work before Presto ever sees\nthe unwanted rows.\nPresto pushes down all the viable predicates (generally just equalities) to the\nconnector.  The connector's use of them is best effort; it must return a\nsuperset of the results that would pass the where clause, but it may return any\nsuperset. Thus, Presto will apply the predicates again to all rows it receives.\nFederated Queries🔗\nA very important consequence of the connector model is that Presto treats all\nrows equally, for any datasource.  In particular, this means that a single query\ncan get rows from different databases, or even different data sources (MySQL and\nHive, for example).\nIn Presto, it's possible to do the following query, which reads from two\ndifferent data sources, and writes to a different database.\nINSERT INTO mysql.metrics.ranking\n  customer_id,\n  customer_ranking,\n  date\nSELECT\n  mysql_customers.customer_id AS customer_id,\n  hive_customers.customer_ranking AS customer_ranking,\n  current_date() AS date\nFROM\n  hive.warehouse.customer_statistics AS hive_customers\nJOIN\n  mysql.users.customers AS mysql_customers\nON mysql_customers.customer_id = hive_customers.customer_id\nWriting output🔗\nCommonly, the results of a query are inserted into another table with an\nINSERT INTO statement.  Presto will stream its output rows into the output\nconnector, which is responsible for writing the data in a format appropriate to\nthe datastore.  Similar to the comment on federated queries above, the output\nconnector can be from a different catalog (and thus different data source) than\nthe input connector(s).  This makes Presto a very efficient way to scrape or\nreplicate tables between different data sources.\n","id":"https://jagill.github.io/zola-test/presto-connectors/","title":"Presto Connectors"},"https://jagill.github.io/zola-test/presto-data-flow/":{"body":"Presto's speed comes from massively parallelizing queries. We've talked about\nhow it plans queries to be parallized, now let's talk about how it organizes\nexecution of queries: clients, coordinators, workers, and channels of\ncommuniation between them.\n\nWhen a client submits a query to Presto, it connects to a coordinator which\nparses the query, plans the computation, and coordinates the flow of data from\nthe connectors to the workers and between workers.  The client can then\nperiodically call back to the coordinator, to retrieve status information and\nany results that have been finished.\nThe coordinator acts as the brains of the operation.  It will parse the query,\nplan the operations, construct the computation DAG, and requisition workers. It\nwill feed the input data from the connector into the upstream workers, retrieve\nresults from the downstream workers, and give status information and results to\nthe client.\nWorkers pull data from upstream workers, perform their computation, and give\ndata to the downstream workers.  Workers will pause working if their output\nbuffer is not being consumed.  Workers are grouped into stages; workers in\none stage pull data from workers in the upstream stage, but don't talk to other\nworkers in their stage.\nThis is part 5 of 5 of a series on Presto:\n\nPresto Overview\nPresto Connectors\nPresto Map-Reduce\nPresto Joins\nPresto Data-Flow\n\nClient🔗\nThe client only talks to the coordinator, via HTTP POST requests.  The client\ninitiates the operation by submitting the query text. The response (in JSON)\ncontains a query handle, which the client uses in subsequent requests to check\nthe status or download partial results. When the client downloads results, the\ncoordinator will flush them from memory, freeing up buffer space for more\nresults.\nIn fact, if the client does not retrieve results before the coordinator's buffer\nis filled, the coordinator will stop retrieving results from the final stage\nworkers, and all of the upstream processes will pause once their buffers are\nfilled. Thus it is critical that the client performs timely retrieval of the\nresults. The client receives results in pages (approximately 1MB each), and can\nrequest up to 16 pages in one request.\nIf the submitted query is an INSERT (or other non-SELECT) statement, the\nresults are just an acknowledgement, and the operation won't block waiting for\nthe client.\nCoordinator🔗\nWhen the coordinator receives the query text (called the statement) from the\nclient, it parses it into the query.  The query determines stages that can\nbe done without transferring data between workers, for example mapping\noperations followed by a partial aggregation (see [Map-Reduce]). The\ncoordinator requisitions workers for each stage and sets up exchanges of data\nbetween them.\nThe coordinator gets an estimate of how many splits of data there are from the\nconnector, monitors the capacity of the workers of the initial stage, and feeds\nsplits to any worker that has capacity.  It also monitors workers of the final\nstage, grabbing completed results and storing them for the client to retrieve.\nWorkers🔗\nWorkers act as nodes in a computation DAG.  They pull data from upstream\nworkers, process it, and store the results in an output buffer for downstream\nworkers to fetch.  If there is room in the output buffer, they repeat this\nprocess.  If the output buffer is full (because the downstream workers aren't\npulling), the worker pauses computation until the buffer has room again.\nData is exchanged in pages, which default to 1 MB.  Workers open long-lived\nHTTP POST connections with their upstreams to fetch pages.  Once a page is\npulled, the upstream worker can delete it from its output buffer.  Presto has a\nconfigurable max page size which defaults to 16 MB; as there must be at least\none row per page, this means the max row size is equal to the max page size.\nQuery Planning🔗\nWhen the coordinator parses the query, it creates a tree of operators, like\nFilter or InnerJoin.  Presto combines sequential operators that can\nrun on one worker into a stage. Between stages, data is exchanged; the\nexchange may distribute data to any worker with capacity\n(round robin exchange), or to a particular worker based on the hash of a key\n(repartitioned exchange).\nA given stage will have one or more pipelines, which are local sequences of\noperators.  For example, a stage with only mapping and filtering operators will\nhave a single pipeline that combines those operators.  But a JOIN stage may\nhave three pipelines: one to read in the build table and build a hashmap, one to\nread the left table, and one to stream the left table through the hashmap and\nproduce the output.  Between pipelines of a given stage are local exchanges,\nwhich are analogous to the exchanges between stages.\nEach stage is parallelized over multiple workers; the \"instance\" of the stage on\na worker is called a task.  For example, if there were N workers in a JOIN\nstage, the kth worker would be responsible for all rows such that\nhash(join_key) % N == k. On a given worker, each pipeline is parallelized into\ndrivers, which divide up the work for the pipeline.  A driver for a pipeline\nof mapping operations might just grab any available data, but a driver that is\nstreaming a left table through a hashmap would futher split the hash table and\nstreaming rows by hashing.  Thus, the Pipeline/Process/Driver parallelization is\nanalogous to that of the Stage/Worker/Task.\n","id":"https://jagill.github.io/zola-test/presto-data-flow/","title":"Presto Data Flow"},"https://jagill.github.io/zola-test/presto-joins/":{"body":"Joining two database tables is one of the harder operations to make\nperformant. They are also foundational to most analytical queries. Let's talk\nabout how Presto performs joins, the choices it makes, and how to make your\nJOIN queries more efficient.\n\nIn Presto, most joins are done by making a hash table of the right-hand table\n(called the build table), and streaming the left-hand table (called the\nprop table) through this map.  It joins those pairs of the left and right\ntables that satisfy the join condition specified in the ON clause.\nFirst we'll look at inner joins, in which rows are joined by an equijoin\ncondition.  Equijoins are one or more equalities between columns in the left and\nright table, like ON customer.id = order.customer_id.  The columns matched\nact as a join key, which we'll use to distribute the join operation. We'll\nthen expand our discussion to various sorts of outer joins, and other join\nconditions.\nNB: Many optimizations and implementation details are left out of this\ndiscussion, to focus on the core principles.\nThis is part 4 of 5 of a series on Presto:\n\nPresto Overview\nPresto Connectors\nPresto Map-Reduce\nPresto Joins\nPresto Data-Flow\n\nBasic Joins🔗\nLet's take a basic example.  Assume we have two tables,\ncities (city_name, country_iso2) and countries (country_name, iso2), and the\nquery\nSELECT city_name, country_name\nFROM cities\nJOIN countries\nON cities.country_iso2 = countries.iso2\n\nConceptually, Presto will take countries and build a hash table\niso2 -&gt; [ROW(country_name, iso2), ...]\n\nmapping the join key to the list of right-hand rows with that key. Iterating\nthrough cities, it will look up the country rows via the join key\ncountry_iso2, yielding a combined row\nROW(cities.city_name, cities.country_iso2, countries.country_name, countries.iso2).\nTo do this, Presto keeps the build table in memory.  This is why it's important\nto put the smaller table on the right.\nIn the example above, the build hashtable has only one row in the entry for\neach value of the iso2 join key.  Multiple cities per country are in the\nstream, and each matches in turn.  If there were more than one build hashtable\nentry per iso2, each matching left-hand row would iterate through the list of\nbuild rows for join key, yielding multiple joined rows.  Hence this method can\nsupport One-to-One, Many-to-One, One-to-Many, and Many-to-Many joins.\nBroadcast Joins🔗\nIf your right table can fit in memory on one machine, you can do this one one\nmachine.  If the streaming table isn't too large, this will even finish\nquickly.  However, if your streaming table has billions of rows, it would take\na long time, but can be easily sped up via parallelization.  If each worker\nmachine has a copy of the build table, then the input streaming rows can be\neasily split across machines, each machine working independently.  This is\ncalled a broadcast join, because the build table is \"broadcasted\" across the\nworkers.  If the build table is much smaller than the prop table, this is\nextremely fast and efficient, but requires the build table to be able to\nfit into memory.\n\nPartitioned Joins🔗\nIf the build table cannot fit onto a single machine, we need to split it across\nthe workers.  This requires us to make sure we stream the rows with a given\njoin key to workers that have the portion of the build table with that same join\nkey.  If we have N workers, we can do this by hashing the join key, and\nputting the entry with hash(join_key) % N == k on worker k.  We direct the\nstreaming rows in the same fashion, which ensures the build table rows with a\ngiven join key get matched with all streaming rows of the same key.\n\nSkew🔗\nIn the example above, some countries likely have more cities than others.  So\neven if the countries are evenly split amongst the workers, some workers will have\nmany more rows than others.  Since the query must wait until the slowest worker\nis complete, this will take longer than if the cities were evenly distributed.\nThis phenomenon is termed skew.  Another cause of skew is if there is some\nspecial value of the join key that has a vastly disproportionate number of\nrows; like null for a nullable column.\nInner vs Outer Joins🔗\nIf a streaming row does not find a match with a join key, it can either be\ndropped (Inner Join), put passed through with null fields instead of the\nmatching right-hand fields (Left Outer Join).\nIn the case of a Right or Full Outer Join, a set of all matched right rows is\nkept by each worker; at the end unmatched right rows are yielded with null\nfields instead of the left-hand fields.\nThis procedure for Right or Full Outer Joins is hard to do if multiple workers\nhave the same build-side join key: a given worker might not find a match, but\nit doesn't know if another worker has found a match.  This would be the case in\na Broadcast join, so specifying either of these will force a Partitioned Join.\nJoin Predicates and Push Downs🔗\nSo far, we've only talked about equijoins, but any predicate can be placed in\nthe ON query.  There are, in general, three types of predicates:\n\nEquijoin predicates: Matching a column in the left table with a column in\nthe right table, e.g. table1.a = table2.b.\nSingle-table predicates: A condition that applies to only one of the two\ntables, e.g. table1.c &lt; 10.\nComplex predicates: Any other condition, generally of the form\nf(table1, table2).\n\nEquijoins, if present, allow the hash table join we described above.\nSingle-table predicates are pushed down and applied as a filter to the\nindividual tables before the join.  Complex predicates have to be applied as the\nrows are being joined.\nIf the join is an inner join, Presto tries to further optimize by pushing down\napplicable predicates in the WHERE clause.  For example, the following\nstatements are equivalent:\nSELECT t1.e, t2.f\nFROM t1 CROSS JOIN t2\nWHERE t1.a = t2.b\n  AND t1.c &lt; 10\n  AND t2.d = 'a'\n\nand\nSELECT t1.e, t2.f\nFROM (\n  SELECT a, e\n  FROM t1\n  WHERE c &lt; 10\n) t1\nJOIN (\n  SELECT b, f\n  FROM t2\n  WHERE d = 'a'\n) t2\nON t1.a = t2.b\n\nSince for outer joins a row that does not match any predicate is yielded (filled\nwith nulls), WHERE-clause predicate pushdown does not happen for outer joins.\nCross Joins🔗\nCross Joins join every row of the left table with every row of the right\ntable.  Because of this reason, they cannot use Partitioned Joins, and so must\nbe a Broadcast Join.  This can easily result in an Out Of Memory error if the\nbuild table is large.  Instead of the hash-table lookup, the join is a\nNested Loop Join, in which the streaming table is iterated over, and each\nstreaming row loops over each build table row.  This quickly becomes inefficient\nif the build table is large.\nSince a cross join is a form of inner join, Presto pushes down predicates in the\nWHERE clause.  If these include equijoins, it converts the join to a\n(non-cross) inner join, and any single-table predicates will filter the joined\ntables.\nSELECT t1.a, t2.b\nFROM t1, t2\nWHERE t1.c = t2.d\n  AND t2.e = 1\n  AND t1.a &lt; t2.b\n\nis equivalent to\nSELECT t1.a, t2.b\nFROM t1\nJOIN (\n  SELECT b, d\n  FROM t2\n  WHERE t2.e = 1\n) t2\nON t1.c = t2.d\nWHERE t1.a &lt; t2.b\nChained Joins🔗\nA Chained Join is multiple joins in a row:\nSELECT *\nFROM table1\nJOIN table2 ON table1.a = table2.a\nJOIN table3 ON table1.a = table3.a\n\nPresto will do the joins one at a time.  First table1 with table2, then the\nresultant table with table3, and so on.\n","id":"https://jagill.github.io/zola-test/presto-joins/","title":"Presto Joins"},"https://jagill.github.io/zola-test/presto-map-reduce/":{"body":"Viewed from afar, the query engine consumes one or more input streams of rows,\nand produces a single output stream of rows.

In\nPresto, this is from a CROSS JOIN UNNEST statement that will expand an array\nor map into rows for each entry.\n\n\nGiven a sequence of mapping operations, Presto combines them into a fragment.\nMultiple workers can perform this fragment, parallelizing the stream processing.\nFor example, let's consider the table orders:\n| order_id  | all_item_quantities\n+-----------+---------------------\n| order_id1 | MAP(ARRAY[price1, price2, ...], ARRAY[quantity1, quantity2, ...])\n+-----------+---------------------\n| ...       | ...\n\nand the query\nSELECT order_id, item_quantity * item_price AS item_total\nFROM orders\nCROSS JOIN UNNEST(all_item_quantities) AS t (item_price, item_quantity)\nWHERE item_quantity &gt; 1\n\nThe incoming rows would be of the form ROW(order_id, all_item_quantities).\nPresto would first apply an unnest operator\nr -&gt; ROW(order_id=r.order_id, item_price=price1, item_quantity=quantity1),\n     ROW(order_id=r.order_id, item_price=price2, item_quantity=quantity2),\n     ...\n\nThe produced rows would be of the form ROW(order_id, item_price, item_quantity).\nNext, Presto will apply a filter operation with predicate\nr -&gt; r.item_quantity &gt; 1\n\nand then a map operation\nr -&gt; ROW(order_id=r.order_id, item_total=r.item_quantity * r.item_price)\n\nThese operators would all be composed into a single fragment.\nReducing Operations🔗\nWhile mapping operations can be easily parallelized, reducing operations (like\nGROUP BY) require more effort to make efficient.  Luckily, Presto does most of\nthis work.  This section will first describe the simple-but-inefficient method,\nand then successive optimizations that Presto does for us.\nIf there is a GROUP BY clause, multiple rows (with the same group key) will be\naggregated into one.  In the simplest case, where there are no aggregation\nfunctions (like SUM(), COUNT(), etc), the worker will just store the row in\nmemory, yielding only one instance.  This is equivalent to SELECT DISTINCT.\nIf there is an aggregation function, the worker must remember the current\naggregation data.  The amount of data stored depends on the function; for some\n(like SUM) this is a single number, while for others (like ARRAY_AGG) it is\na field for each row aggregated over.\nA non-efficient but correct model would be to partition the rows amongst workers\nusing the hash of the group key; this ensures a mostly equal distribution, which\nall rows for a given key going to the same worker. This worker can then fully\naggregate, knowing it has seen all the relevant rows.  However, using\npartial aggregation we can do this much more efficiently.\nConsider the following query:\nSELECT user_id, SUM(order_amount) AS total_spent\nFROM orders\nGROUP BY user_id\n\nAssume the first phase is split amongst two mapping workers M1 and M2\n(perhaps orders is actually a complex subquery), and there are two grouping\nworkers G1 and G2, where G1 will handle all odd user_ids and G2 will\nhandle all even user_ids.  The inefficient way would be for each mapping\nworker to send each row to either G1 or G2, depending on the user_id.\nHowever, M1 and M2 could locally store a hash table {user_id: partial_sum}.  Then, once they have consumed all the rows, they can send these\npartial sums to the appropriate grouping worker.  This is far less data than\nsending the individual rows!  G1 and G2 can then do a simple sum of the\npartial sums for each user_id they get.\nFuthermore, the mapping workers don't have to wait until they have consumed all\nrows; they can send partial sums whenever they are running low on memory! The\ngrouping workers will get a (relatively slow) stream of partial sums, which they\nwill aggregate to the final sums.\nOften, a more complex function can be made partially aggregable with an\nintermediate representation.  Consider the arithmetic mean operator avg.\nPresto cannot simply average different slice of data and then average the\naverages. Instead, Presto partially aggregates into a structure {key:, sum:, count:}, and then aggregates the partial aggregations.  Any function that can\nbe represented in this way can be efficiently aggregated in parallel.\nIntermediate Representation Example🔗\nConsider another example: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT x).  The naive method would be\nto have a single node at the end, collecting all values of x into a set, then\nevaluating the size of the set.  The first optimization is that the upstream\nworker nodes could maintain their own partial set.  The final node would union\nall these sets, returning the size as above.  Although parallelizable, the\nstorage requirements still scale as O(num_outputs).\nPresto implements COUNT(DISTINCT X) as\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM (\n  SELECT x\n  FROM t\n  GROUP BY x\n)\n\nWith this, Presto partitions the inner query across workers by hashing x.\nEach worker stores the set of distinct x for a partition, counts it, then\npasses the count to the final aggregator.  While the total storage is still\nO(num_outputs), it's distributed over many machines.\nHowever, if a small approximation is acceptable, vastly more performant options\nare available.  The function approx_distinct uses a fast, constant-space,\nand parallelizable intermediate representation called\nHyperLogLog.\nEach upstream worker node can accumate their intermediate representation, and\nthe final node can combine these to the final estimate.\nSorting Operations🔗\nSQL also has the ORDER BY clause.  In the current implementation, by default\nthe merge is performed on a single worker.  This may lead to a OOM error for\nlarge datasets.  Distributed merge can be enabled by the distributed_sort\nsession parameter.  In distributed sort, each worker sorts a part of the data\nand sends it to a worker for a final merge sort.\n","id":"https://jagill.github.io/zola-test/presto-map-reduce/","title":"Presto Map Reduce"},"https://jagill.github.io/zola-test/presto-overview/":{"body":"Presto is a fast SQL query engine, but it's different than most technologies\nin its class. Understanding the philosophy and architecture of Presto allows\nyou to write more performant queries, and debug misbehaving ones. In these\narticles, you'll learn about Presto's approach to map-reduce, joins, data\nsources, and data flow. You'll understand why some join conditions are more\nefficient than others, why the small table should be on the right, when to\nuse distributed joins, and how to structure your subqueries.\n\nThese articles are aimed at developers who use Presto, but want to understand\nhow the magic happens. This is not an introductory tutorial, nor is it\naimed at DBA-level optimization. The goal is to give a simplified but\nreasonably accurate mental model of how things work under the hood. We avoid\ndetails that would obfuscate the high-level understanding. Conversely, we\nassume the reader has some experience working with Presto, or at least SQL.\nThis is part 1 of 5 of a series on Presto:\n\nPresto Overview\nPresto Connectors\nPresto Map-Reduce\nPresto Joins\nPresto Data-Flow\n\nCore Concept 1: SQL Query Engine, not Datastore🔗\nPresto, at its heart, has no concept of disks or where data is stored.  It\ndelegates that to connectors, which read data from (and write to) popular\ndatastores such as MySQL, Hive, etc.  The connectors stream rows into Presto,\nwhich process them, streaming the results out to clients or other connectors.\nThis has the important effects:\n\n\nAll datasources are equivalent to Presto, and you can write federated\nqueries which combine multiple databases and even datastores.\n\n\nPresto has no native concept of indices, primary keys, partitions, or other\nthings that make storage and access more efficient.  Logic for these must\nreside in the connector.\n\n\nCore Concept 2: In-memory and streaming🔗\nPresto is blazingly fast compared to Hive, Pig, etc, because it does not perform\nany disk IO while processing a query.  It streams data, transforming each row,\nand passing data to other machines via sockets.\nThis has several important consequences:\n\n\nSince there is no disk IO, Presto is fast.\n\n\nSince it cannot store data to disk, Presto is memory limited.\n\n\nPresto only reads enough data to fill the pipeline; if one step stops,\neverything upstream stops too.\n\n\nSince it streams data, it cannot inspect data for optimization.  Each stage\nsees each row only once.\n\n\nAcknowledgements🔗\nThese articles would have been impossible without the help of Presto team members\nMaria Basmanova ( mbasmanova),\nRebecca Schlussel ( rschlussel), and\nAndrii Rosa ( arhimondr).\n","id":"https://jagill.github.io/zola-test/presto-overview/","title":"Presto Overview"},"https://jagill.github.io/zola-test/python-generators/":{"body":"One of Python's strengths is its powerful generators.  Even a basic understand\nof them unlocks the the ability to elegantly handle even huge datasets.  But\nthey hold some suprises in what is executed when -- understand them at a deeper\nlevel allows you to use and debug them more effectively.\nIterables and Iterators🔗\nFirst, some basics.  An iterable is an object like a list or a tuple\nthat can be iterated over in a for loop.  We will see shortly that there are\nother types of iterables.\na = [1, 2, 3]\nfor i in a:\n    print(i)\n# 1\n# 2\n# 3\n\nAn iterator itr is an object with an __next()__ method which yields the\nnext object to be iterated over. If there are no more objects, next() will\ninstead raise a StopIteration exception. The pythonic way to do this is the\nbuiltin next function: next(itr). There is a deep connection between\niterables and iterators; part of the iterable contract is that an iterable\nmust expose an __iter__() method which returns an iterator. The pythonic\nway to call this is using the builtin iter() method: iter(a)\na = [1, 2]\nitr = iter(a)\nprint(next(itr))\n# 1\nprint(next(itr))\n# 2\nprint(next(itr))\n# StopIteration\n\nIn fact, the for loop over an iterable a can be implemented as:\n# Vanilla for loop\nfor x in a:\n  f(x)\n\n# or the iterator version\nitr = iter(a)\nwhile True:\n  try:\n    x = next(itr)\n  except StopIteration:\n    break\n  f(x)\n\nTo make life slightly easier, iterators must also be iterables; i.e. they\nmust expose the __iter__ method, which in this case will just return\nthemselves:\niter([1, 2, 3]) is [1, 2, 3]\n# False\nitr = iter([1, 2, 3])\niter(itr) is itr\n# True\n\nOne important difference between iterators and most iterables is that\niterators are always one-shot, while iterables might be able to be consumed\nmore than once. If call next on an iterator (in a for loop or otherwise),\nyou are consuming one iteration, and it can't be consumed again. When you\niterate over most iterables (like lists, etc), you create a new iterator,\nwhich starts from the beginning.\na = [1, 2]\nb = iter([1, 2])\n\ndef print1(itbl):\n    for x in itbl:\n        print(x)\n        break\n\nprint1(a)\n# 1\nprint1(a)\n# 1\nprint1(a)\n# 1\nprint1(b)\n# 1\nprint1(b)\n# 2\nprint1(b)\n# Nothing!  We have exhausted b already.\n\nIn fact, for many iterables, you can create multiple independent iterators:\na = [1, 2, 3]\nb = iter(a)\nc = iter(a)\nnext(b)\n# 1\nnext(c)\n# 1\nnext(c)\n# 2\nnext(c)\n# 3\nnext(c)\n# StopIteration\nnext(b)\n# 2\nnext(b)\n# 3\nnext(b)\n# StopIteration\n\nTo summarize, an iterable is something that exposes an iterator via iter, and\nan iterator is something that you can call next on.\nGenerators🔗\nIf you use the yield keyword in a function, it does not return a normal value,\nbut instead returns a generator.\ndef f():\n  yield 1\n\ng = f()\ntype(g)\n# &lt;type 'generator'&gt;\n\nGenerators are in fact iterators.\nprint(next(g))\n# 1\nprint(next(g))\n# StopIteration\n\nEach time you call the function, you'll get a new, independent, iterator.\ndef f():\n  yield 1\n\ng1 = f()\ng2 = f()\nprint(next(g1))\n# 1\nprint(next(g1))\n# StopIteration\nprint(next(g2))\n# 1\nprint(next(g2))\n# StopIteration\n\nOne of the most important features of a generator is that it lazily yields\nvalues. Between next calls, it suspends execution, but maintains its\ninternal state. The classic example is the infinite counter, which lazily\nproduces an infinite sequence of integers.\ndef counter():\n  c = 0\n  while True:\n    yield c\n    c += 1\n\ncount = counter()\nprint(next(count))\n# 0\nprint(next(count))\n# 1\n\nThis will never raise a StopIteration; it will continue to count forever.  Be\ncareful not to iterate it in a for loop without a break statement!\nLet's examine the sequence of operations of this simple generator more closely.\ndef counter():\n    print('Starting counter')\n    c = 0\n    while True:\n        yield c\n        c += 1\n        print('Incremented counter to', c)\n\ncount = counter()\ny = next(count)\n# Starting counter\nprint('Counted', y)\n# Counted 0\ny = next(count)\n# Incremented counter to 1\nprint('Counted', y)\n# Counted 1\n\nLet's examine the flow:\n\ncount = counter()  initializes the generator, assigning to count an\niterator.  Notice it does not execute anything inside of counter.\ny = next(count) iterates the iterator, executing the code in counter up\nto the first time we yield.  It assigns the yielded value 0 to y.\nprint 'Counted', y prints the yielded value 0.\ny = next(count) executes the loop from the first yield to the second.  It\nalso assigns the yielded value 1 to y.\nprint 'Counted', y prints the yielded value 1.\n\nSending🔗\nThis is a basic generator that you can use to iterate/etc. But yield also\nhas a special power; it can receive values from the outside the function and\nassign them to variables inside. Let's make a basic consumer:\ndef printer():\n    print('Starting printer')\n    while True:\n        x = yield\n        print('Printing', x)\n\np = printer()\ny = next(p)\n# Starting printer\nprint('Outside', y)\n# Outside None\ny = next(p)\n# Printing None\nprint('Outside', y)\n# Outside None\n\nThis creates a generator that doesn't yield anything.  Let's follow the flow.\n\np = printer() creates p, which does not do any execution.\ny = next(p) executes printer up to the line x = yield, which\nwaits for iteration.  Since we didn't specify anything to yield that's the\nequivalent of yield None, and y is assigned to None.\nprint('Outside', y) Since y is None, we print Outside None.\ny = next(p) executes printer from the yield.  We assign the result of\nthe yield expression to x.  This is also None, because we didn't send\nanything -- foreshadowing!  Since we are yet again not yielding anything,\nNone is returned and assigned to y.\nprint('Outside', y) Since y is None, we print Outside None.\n\nFor yield to actually receive information, we need to use the send method\nof the generator.  In the above example, we didn't send anything to p, because\nwe wanted to emphases that printer is just a normal generator, but that\nyield actually returns a value that can be assigned to a variable.  Now let's\nactually get to send:\np = printer()\ny = p.send(None)\n# Starting printer\nprint('Outside', y)\n# Outside None\ny = p.send('a')\n# Printing a\nprint('Outside', y)\n# Outside None\np.send(2)\n# Printing 2\n\nNow we're sending things to the generator to be processed.  Let's follow the\nflow.\n\np = printer() creates p, which does not do any execution.\ny = p.send(None) starts the generators execution, exactly like next(p)\nwould.  In fact, you could replace this with next(p) and it would be the same.\nYou need to \"prime\" the generator in this way; if you try to send a non-None\nvalue to a just-started generator, it will throw an error.\nprint('Outside', y) prints the value of y, which is None, because send\nhas no return value.\ny = p.send('a') sends the value 'a' to the generator.  The line\nx = yield means that it will assign to x the value that is sent, in this\ncase 'a', and so that is printed before we loop around to the yield\nstatement again.\nprint('Outside', y) shows that y is still None, and will always be so.\np.send(2) sends the value 2, which is printed as expected.\n\nNow how do we tie these together?  Here's a very simple way:\ncount = counter()\np = printer()\np.send(None)\nfor x in range(3)\n    p.send(next(count))\n\n# &gt; Starting counter\n# &gt; Printing 0\n# &gt; Incremented counter to 1\n# &gt; Printing 1\n# &gt; Incremented counter to 2\n# &gt; Printing 2\n\nWe say that count is a producer (because it is yielding results to the\noutside), and p is a consumer, because we are sending values to it. Of\ncourse, we can have a generator that consumes a producer.\ndef times2(gen):\n    print('Starting times2')\n    while True:\n        x = next(gen)\n        print('Multiplying %s by 2' % x)\n        yield 2*x\n\ncount = counter()\nt2 = times2(count)\nnext(t2)\n# &gt; Starting times2\n# &gt; Starting counter\n# &gt; Multiplying 0 by 2\n# 0\nnext(t2)\n# &gt; Incremented counter to 1\n# &gt; Multiplying 1 by 2\n# 2\n\nThe while statement above is actually just a cumbersome for loop. It\ncould be written as\ndef times2(gen):\n    for x in gen:\n        yield 2*x\n","id":"https://jagill.github.io/zola-test/python-generators/","title":"Python Generators"}},"docInfo":{"https://jagill.github.io/zola-test/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://jagill.github.io/zola-test/about/":{"body":78,"title":4},"https://jagill.github.io/zola-test/articles/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://jagill.github.io/zola-test/computer-memory/":{"body":2428,"title":3},"https://jagill.github.io/zola-test/git-dag/":{"body":972,"title":3},"https://jagill.github.io/zola-test/git-remote/":{"body":1524,"title":3},"https://jagill.github.io/zola-test/git-reset/":{"body":1339,"title":2},"https://jagill.github.io/zola-test/pages/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://jagill.github.io/zola-test/presto-connectors/":{"body":474,"title":2},"https://jagill.github.io/zola-test/presto-data-flow/":{"body":513,"title":3},"https://jagill.github.io/zola-test/presto-joins/":{"body":763,"title":2},"https://jagill.github.io/zola-test/presto-map-reduce/":{"body":645,"title":3},"https://jagill.github.io/zola-test/presto-overview/":{"body":247,"title":2},"https://jagill.github.io/zola-test/python-generators/":{"body":799,"title":2}},"length":14},"lang":"English"};
